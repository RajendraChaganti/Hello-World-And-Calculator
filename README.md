# Experiment No. 1 â€” Hello World and Calculator Program (C++)

### Aim

To write a C++ program that:

- Prints Hello World as the first output.
- Takes two numbers from the user.
- Performs and displays addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Apparatus

- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++)
- iostream header file
- Keyboard for input

### Note

- This program uses basic cin and cout operations.
- It has no if, else, or switch statements.
- It performs all 4 operations unconditionally.
- NOTE: See arrows used in output (cout <<) and input (cin >>) carefully.

### Program Explanation

- Displays "Hello World" using cout.
- Takes two float numbers as input using cin.
- Performs four operations:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
- Results are printed directly using cout.

### About `#include <iostream>` and `using namespace std;`

- `#include <iostream>` is used for input/output in C++.
- `using namespace std;` allows direct use of cin and cout without prefixing `std::`.

### About the Calculator

- The calculator logic is direct and simple.
- It performs all operations on two inputs.
- Division is also shown as a floating-point result since we use float data type.

### Conclusion

We learnt how to print hello world and how to perform calculator operations in C++.
